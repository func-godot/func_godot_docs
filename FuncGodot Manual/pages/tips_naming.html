        <h1>Naming Patterns</h1>
        <p>
            Recall that every entity has a <b>classname</b> that we define in our Entity Definition resource. One important consideration to make 
            is that <i>naming conventions matter</i>. The first word of an entity's name up until the first underscore will be provided its own group 
            in the map editor. Taking advantage of this can help keep your entities organized in a few spots and in some editors provide convenient filtering options.

            When combined with <a href="ref_trenchbroom_resources.html#Tag" target="main">brush tags</a> in TrenchBroom configurations, this feature gains additional powers 
            like in-editor transparency and keyboard shortcuts.

        <p>
            FuncGodot has a pair of prebuilt TrenchBroomTag resources for <b>func*</b> and <b>trigger*</b> brush classes. Feel free to use these either directly or as a base for 
            your own brush tags.

            Additionally, your map editor will also handle Point Class orientation through the key value pairs <b>angle</b> and <b>mangle</b> differently 
            depending upon the classname. Setting the mangle for an entity type in the "light_*" group or with the "info_intermission" classname will have altered orientation 
            behavior. To see the differences, try to parse the code block in <a href="ref_func_godot_map.html">FuncGodotMap</a> that handles translating Quake angles 
            into Godot rotations:

        <p>
            Anyway, just make sure to give a little bit more thought to your naming conventions.
